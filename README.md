# Finger-Print-Biometric-Attendance
Attendance systems are commonly used systems to mark the presence in offices and schools. From manually marking the attendance in attendance registers is not so efficient in compare to high-tech applications and biometric systems, these systems have improved significantly in past years by introduction of biometric security systems in small mobile equipment like smartphones. In this project, we used fingerprint Module and Arduino to take and keep attendance data and records. By using fingerprint sensor, the system will become more secure for the users as well as efficient for the database management. Fingerprint attendance system aims to automate the attendance procedure of an educational institution using biometric technology. This will save time wasted on calling out names and it gives a fool-proof method of attendance marking. A hand-held device is used to mark the attendance without the intervention of teacher. The device can be passed and students can mark attendance during the lecture time. Students would be made to place their finger over the sensor so as to mark their presence in the class. It can communicate with a host computer using its USB interface. This device operates from a rechargeable battery. GUI application in host computer helps the teacher to manage the device and attendance.
